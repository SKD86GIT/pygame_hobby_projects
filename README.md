# Pygame Hobby Projects 🎮

A collection of **pygame mini-projects and experiments** built while learning
game development concepts such as **delta-time movement**, **OOP design**, and
**Unity-style game loop architecture**.

This repository is intended for **learning, experimentation, and teaching**.

---

## ✨ Key Concepts Covered

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Unity-style game loop (`handle_events → update → draw`)
- Delta-time based movement (frame-rate independent)
- Keyboard input handling
- Clean project structure
- Git & GitHub best practices
